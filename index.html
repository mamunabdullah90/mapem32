        <p><span>Brothers of mine,</span><br>
            Today I appear before you with a heavy heart. You know and understand everything. We tried with our lives.
            But the painful matter is that now the streets of Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna, Rajshahi and Rangpur are
            stained with the bloods of my brothers.<br>
            Now the people of Bengal want freedom. The people of Bengal want to live. The people of Bengal want to have
            their rights. What wrong did we commit?<br>
            The people of Bangladesh cast their vote overwhelmingly for me, for Awami League. Our National Assembly will
            sit. We will draw up the Constitution there. And we will build this country. The people of this country will
            have economic, political and cultural freedom. But it’s a matter of great sorrow that today I have to tell
            painfully the pitiful history of the last twenty-three years. The bloody history of Bengalis tortured in
            Bengal itself. The history of the last twenty- three years is the history of the wailing of dying men and
            women. The history of Bengal is the history of the staining of streets with the blood of the People of this
            country. <br>
            We gave blood in 1952. After winning the election in 1954, we couldn’t even form the government. Proclaiming
            martial law in 1958, Ayub Khan made us slaves for ten years. During the ‘Six Point Movement’, my children
            were gunned down on 7th June 1966. After; the fall of Ayub Khan brought about the ‘Mass Movement’ of 1969
            where Yahya Khan usurped power. He said he would give constitution and democracy to the nation. We Agreed.
            Thereafter the rest is history. There was an election. You know the fault was not ours. Today I met
            President Yahya Khan and discussed everything with him. Being the leader of not only of Bengal but of the
            majority party of Pakistan, I requested him to convene the National Assembly of 15th February. <br>
            He didn’t agree with me, rather he yielded to Mr. Bhutto’s demand to hold the assembly in the first week of
            March. We said that was alright. We would sit in the Assembly. I went even to the extent of saying that if
            anybody, even a lone person proposed something reasonable, we, although the majority will accept the
            proposal. Mr. Bhutto came here. He conferred with us and said that the door for discussion was not closed.
            There would be more discussions. Then we talked with other leaders and said ‘please come and sit together;
            let’s prepare the Constitution through discussion’. Mr. Bhutto said that if the members of West Pakistan
            came here, the Assembly would turn into a slaughter house. He said whoever would come would be killed. If
            they came to the Assembly, then from Peshawar to Karachi, all shops will be closed down by force. I said
            that Assembly would continue, then all of a sudden, the Assembly was closed on 1st March. As President, Mr.
            Yahya Khan had summoned the Assembly. I said that I would attend. Mr. Bhutto said that he won’t. Thirty-
            five members from West Pakistan came here. Then all of a sudden, the Assembly was closed. The people of
            Bengal were blamed; I was blamed too. Because of the closure, the people of this country burst into protest.
            I told them to observe ‘hartal’ (strike) in a peaceful manner I told them to close down all mills and
            factories. The people responded. The people spontaneously came out on the streets. They firmly pledged to
            continue their resistance in a peaceful manner. <br>
            What did we get? The weapons we bought at the expense of our money to protect the country from the invasion
            of foreign enemies, are now being used against the poor and unarmed people of our country; they are being
            shot down. We are the majority of the people of Pakistan. Whenever we Bengalis tried to gain power; tried to
            rule this country as our own, they assaulted. They are our brother; I asked them ‘Why must you shoot your
            brother? You were deployed to protect this country from the attack of foreign enemies.’ Mr. Yahya said that
            I had agreed that there would be a Round Table Conference (RTC) on 10th March. I said no such thing to him.
            I had a talk with him over the telephone. I told him ‘General Yahya Khan, you are President of Pakistan.
            Come to Dhaka and see the how my poor people, my people of Bengal are being shot down. How the bosom of our
            mothers are being emptied of their sons. How my people are being killed. You come, see and do justice and
            then finalize. That’s exactly what I told him. <br>
            I told him long ago, RTC for what? Who do we sit with? With them… who spilled the blood of my people?
            Without any consultation, with me or any discussion with us, suddenly after 5 hours of secret meeting, Yahya
            Khan delivered his speech, in which he dumped all the blame squarely on me, squarely on the people of
            Bengal. (The crowds say shame, shame). I have said in the meeting, the struggle this time is our struggle
            for emancipation, the struggle this time is the struggle for our independence.
            <br>
            Brothers of mine. The Assembly has summoned on the 25th March. The marks of bloods have not yet dried. I had
            clearly said on 10th March that Mujib Raman can’t joint RTC, treading the bloods of martyrs. They have
            called the Assembly. They have got to accept my demands: First, martial law must be withdrawn; <br>
            All army personnel must go back to the barracks; There has to be an inquiry into the way the killings were
            carried outland the power has to be handed over to the people’s representatives. Only then, we will consider
            whether we can sit in the Assembly or not. Before that we can’t sit in the Assembly. The people have not
            given me that right. <br>
            <span>Brothers of mine,</span> <br>
            Do you have faith in me? (The crowd says yes, yes) I don’t want Prime Ministership. We want to establish the
            right of the people of this country. I want to say in clear terms that from now on all courts, magistrates,
            offices and educational institutions in Bangladesh will remain closed sine die. <br>
            To ensure that no suffering is inflicted on the poor people, to ensure that my people do not suffer, from
            tomorrow the following things will be put out of range of the ‘hartal’. Rickshaws and hackney carriages will
            work; railway trains and launches will run. But the Secretariat, Supreme Court, High Court, Judge’s Court
            and semi-government offices like WAPDA (Pakistan Water Development Authority) will not function. All
            employees will draw their salaries on the 28th of the month. If salaries are not paid; if one more shot is
            fired and if my people are killed again then my request to you is; build a fortress in each and every home.
            Face the enemy with whatever you have. In case I can’t give you any further order, I tell you; close all
            roads and highway indefinitely. <br>
            We will starve them to death. We will make them go without water and choke them to death. You are our
            brothers. You stay in your barracks; no one will say anything to you. But don’t ever try to shoot us. This
            will do you no good. You can’t keep seven crores of people subjugated. Since we have learnt to die, no one
            can dominate us. We, from Awami League, will try our best to help those who are embracing martyrdom and
            those who have received injuries. Those who are capable, please extend your monetary support, whatever you
            can to our relief fund. And every owner of industries will pay salaries to all workers who participated in
            the 7-day ‘hartal’. My instruction to government officials is that you must obey what I say. From now on,
            tax will not be paid till such time as the freedom of our country is achieved; no one will pay anything.
            Listen and bear in mind, the enemy has penetrated us in order to create divisions amongst us and to start
            looting. <br>
            Hindus, Muslims, Bengalis and non-Bengalis, all those who live in this Bangla are our brothers. The
            responsibility of protecting them is on you. Ensure that our reputation is not smeared in any way. The
            employees of the Radio and Television; please bear in mind that if our words are not broadcasted by the
            radio, then no Bengali shall go to the radio station. If our news is not broadcasted by Television, then no
            Bengali will go to the Television station. The ban shall remain open for two hours every day so that the
            people can get their salaries. But from East Bangla, a single paisa will not be allowed to be remitted to
            West Pakistan. Telephone and Telegraph service will remain operative in our East Bengal. They shall keep on
            sending our news to foreign news media. But if there is any sinister move to annihilate the people of this
            country, the Bengalis, you will have to keep very careful watch. <br>
            I am requesting you - you are my brothers. Do not make this country a hell and destroy it. Do not make this
            country a hell and destroy it. We will not see each other’s face in the future. If we can solve things in a
            peaceful manner, we can at least live as brothers. That is why I am requesting you; do not try and run
            military rule in my country. Secondly, in every village, every locality, every union and every sub-division
            establish ‘Resistant Council’ under the leadership of the Awami League. And be ready with whatever you have.
            <br>
            Bear in mind that since we have given blood, we will give more. By the grace of Allah, we will surely
            liberate the people of this country. <br>
            The struggle this time is the struggle for our emancipation. The struggle this time is the struggle for our
            independence. <br>
